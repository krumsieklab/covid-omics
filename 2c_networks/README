This folder contains the script to 
  (1) calculate a GGM from metabolomics and proteomics data 
  (2) retrieve case-control statistics to annotate the GGM
  (3) calculate the MST network based on (1) and (2) as explained in the paper 


-- code file to start analysis -- 
  main_GGM_analysis.R


-- input data file -- 
  "/1_preprocessing/data_preprocessed_for_GGM.Rdata"
which includes preprocessed data for GGM. For maximal power, all samples 
are used. Data is corrected for age, gender and status.


-- output file --
  "/results/igraph_networks.Rdata"
which includes following networks,
  net1: GGM with FDR=0.2 
  net2: Figure 3 simplified MST network of significant hits
