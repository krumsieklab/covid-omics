This folder contains the scripts for predicting the risk of
composite outcome using reor4me: regularized linear mixed effect ordinal regression. 


-- code file to start analysis -- 
  main_prediction_modeling.R
  main_prediction_modeling_lasso_path.R
  main_prediction_master_fit.R
  folder: model/ includes necessary scripts to fit reor4me model 


-- input data file -- 
  "data_for_predictive_modeling.Rdata"
which includes data ready for predictive modeling


-- output files --
  "lasso_loo_fits" 
  "lasso_path_loo_fits"
includes objects for reor4me model fits and lasso path which is used to 
calculate accuracy vs parsimony tradeoff which can be seen in supplementary figure. 

  "reor4me_signatures"
includes final model signature that is selected metabolites along with corresponding regression coefficients
